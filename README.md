MOCY provides time series of weekly death counts stratified by country, sex, and age along with useful covariates such as person-weeks exposure time, population-weighted weekly temperature, and public holiday indicators.

This repository contains the source files needed to compile the MOCY database. The compiled data is hosted at [osf.io/k84rz](https://osf.io/k84rz/).

## Sources

Weekly population-weighted average temperature by country and year calculated from:

- Global gridded population 2010 [1]
- Global national grid embedded in [1]
- Daily global gridded temperature [2]
